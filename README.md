# Early-alzheimer-s-detection-application

-Our main target audience are those people who are in various stages of Alzheimer. Also we are focusing on those audience who suspect any problem regarding memory loss, thinking ability and problem solving. The audience can easily download this App for free and can follow all the subsequent steps given in the App, hence receive an accurate result. They should use this App for early and effective detection of Alzheimer. It is definitely a good choice to use this App as it is free to download and thus save money by not actually going through payable test conducted by Psychologist or Doctors.
This idea of developing an App for early Alzheimer detection can be implemented when the audience wish to go through an Alzheimer test. This App can be used by any individual and hence get a self-analysis in-spite of going any where else for testing. 
-In most of the demography it is observed that Alzheimer is found in the people of higher age groups which is quiet natural. But if anyone of not belonging to higher age group i.e. either being an adult or a child, is facing this problem then they can instantly use this App without spending any amount. This solution will be very effective if it is implemented on a large scale and thus we can get better Alzheimer detection result and accurate statistics of masses facing this problem. Thereafter necessary actions can be taken for the same.
